## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective  
HeatH integrates web and mobile interfaces using a RESTful API.  
All user-generated activities (e.g., posting recipes, liking) follow the **W3C ActivityStreams 2.0** model for interoperability.



### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
| User Type | Description | Access Level |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Regular User | Can register, plan meals, and post/like/save meals | Basic |
| Administrator | Manages data integrity, security, and compliance | Full |

### 2.3 Operating Environment  
- **Frontend:** React (web) / React Native (mobile)  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST API  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Hosting:** Deployed via CI/CD on GCP  

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints  
- Must comply with **W3C Accessibility** and **GDPR** standards  
- Follows RESTful architecture and JSON-LD data format  
- Uses open-source frameworks with permissive licenses

## 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Usability** | Interfaces shall comply with WCAG 2.1 standards, including contrast ratio, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels for accessibility. |
| **Security** | All data shall be encrypted using TLS 1.3 in transit and AES-256 at rest. |
| **Performance** | The system shall respond to 95% of user requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions. |
| **Reliability** | The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime and provide automated database backup replication. |
| **Ethics & Privacy** | Users must provide explicit consent for data processing and have the right to delete their data at any time. |
