## 1. Overview
This Project Plan outlines the complete development roadmap, milestones, and deliverables for the *HeatH ‚Äì Affordable and Healthy Eating Hub* project.  
It aligns with the course‚Äôs Agile iteration model and incorporates participatory, ethical, and accessible design principles following **W3C**, **WCAG**, and **JSON-LD ActivityStreams** standards.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Deliver an accessible and ethical web/mobile platform for affordable healthy eating.  
- Integrate participatory UX principles involving users.  
- Ensure semantic interoperability through **W3C ActivityStreams 2.0**.  
- Integrate external nutritional intelligence via **FatSecret API** for real-time calorie and macro data.  
- Provide clear milestones, issue tracking, and CI/CD monitoring through GitHub.

---

## 3. Methodology
The project follows an **Agile‚ÄìScrum** methodology:
- **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks  
- **Tools:** GitHub Projects (Kanban), Issues, Pull Requests, Milestones  
- **Roles:**
  - *Backend Developer:* Handles backend development, API integration (including FatSecret), and deployment.  
  - *Frontend Web Developer:* Handles frontend web development and testing tasks.  
  - *Frontend Mobile Developer:* Handles mobile development, UI integration, and testing.

## 6. Task Breakdown by Component

### 6.1 Backend (Spring Boot)
- Implement RESTful endpoints for users, recipes, and activities.  
- Integrate **FatSecret API** for external food and nutrition data.  
- Use JSON-LD for ActivityStreams event modeling.  
- Connect PostgreSQL with schema validation and ORM (JPA).  
- Cache nutrition responses and handle API rate limits gracefully.

### 6.2 Frontend (React / React Native)
- Develop responsive UI using Material UI.  
- Integrate **nutrition lookup and display** (calories, macros) for recipes.  
- Implement meal planner, affordability calculator, and recipe feed.  
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance (contrast, ARIA, keyboard navigation).  

### 6.3 Database (PostgreSQL)
- Extend schema to include nutrition data fields (calories, protein, carbs, fat).  
- Cache frequently accessed nutrition queries with TTL expiration.  
- Ensure encrypted storage of user preferences and API tokens.  

### 6.4 Ethics & Accessibility
- Implement user consent flow for third-party API (FatSecret) usage.  
- Document external data source and data processing transparency.  
- Maintain accessibility best practices (labels, contrast, ARIA).  

### 6.5 CI/CD 
- Linting, unit testing, and API mock tests.  
- Docker-based staging environment with GitHub Actions workflow.  
- Secure handling of FatSecret API credentials using environment variables.

## 7. Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------------|
| Delays in backend integration | Parallel frontend mock API testing |
| Delays in frontend & mobile integration | Backend support with temporary endpoints |
| FatSecret API rate limits or downtime | Local caching of results; mock API fallback |
| API schema or token changes | Encapsulated adapter layer and scheduled health checks |
| Ethical or privacy concerns | Instructor review of consent flow and third-party data usage |

---

## 8. Participation & Communication Plan
- **Weekly Meetings:** Every Tuesday during Lab Hours.  
- **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues with labels `backend`, `frontend`, `api`, `documentation`, `accessibility`.  
- **Progress Tracking:** GitHub Project Kanban board.  
- **Communication Channels:** WhatsApp + GitHub Discussions.
